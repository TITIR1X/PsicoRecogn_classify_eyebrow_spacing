# PsicoRecogn_classify_eyebrow_spacing
The program allows to detect and classify eyebrow-to-eye distances in three categories: near, medium and far. With exceptional accuracy, the program saves the worked images in separate folders according to their classification and provides a document describing the personality trait associated with each folder of faces.

The program is prepared to scan a folder with 500px x 500px images of faces, you can create these 500x500px images with this tool: https://github.com/TITIR1X/capture_face_live
or this tool: https://github.com/TITIR1X/large_scale_face_capturer
