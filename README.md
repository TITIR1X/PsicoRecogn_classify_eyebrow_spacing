# PsicoRecogn_classify_eyebrow_spacing
The program allows to detect and classify eyebrow-to-eye distances in three categories: near, medium and far. With exceptional accuracy, the program saves the worked images in separate folders according to their classification and provides a document describing the personality trait associated with each folder of faces.
